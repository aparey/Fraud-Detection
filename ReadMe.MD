# Machine Learning Classifier Comparison

This project compares three different machine learning models: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to determine the best-performing model for predicting the `card` column in a dataset.

## Project Structure

- **data.csv**: The dataset used for training and testing the models. This file is expected to contain a `card` column as the target variable and several feature columns.
- **classifier_comparison.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the complete code to run the model comparisons.
- **model_results.txt**: Output file containing the accuracy of each model and the best-performing model.
- **README.md**: This readme file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
    - `pandas`
    - `numpy`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `seaborn`
    - `scikit-learn`

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
